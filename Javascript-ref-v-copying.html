    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; /*<-- team is just a reference, not a copy of the original array*/


    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
        const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;


    // how do we take a copy instead?
        const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99});
        
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}; //you've seen this in react... This isn't currently available in ES6, but one day soon hopefully!
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
